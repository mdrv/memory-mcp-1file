A high-performance, **pure Rust** Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides persistent, semantic, and graph-based memory for AI agents.

Works perfectly with:
*   **Claude Desktop**
*   **Claude Code** (CLI)
*   **Gemini CLI**
*   **Cursor**
*   **OpenCode**
*   **Cline** / **Roo Code**
*   Any other MCP-compliant client.

### 🏆 The "All-in-One" Advantage

Unlike other memory solutions that require a complex stack (Python + Vector DB + Graph DB), this project is **a single, self-contained executable**.

*   ✅ **No External Database** (SurrealDB is embedded)
*   ✅ **No API Keys, No Cloud, No Python** — Everything runs **100% locally** via an embedded ONNX runtime. The embedding model is baked into the binary and runs on CPU. Nothing leaves your machine.
*   ✅ **Zero Setup** (Just run one Docker container or binary)

It combines:
1.  **Vector Search** (FastEmbed) for semantic similarity.
2.  **Knowledge Graph** (PetGraph) for entity relationships.
3.  **Code Indexing** with **symbol graph** (calls, extends, implements) for deep codebase understanding.
4.  **Hybrid Retrieval** (Reciprocal Rank Fusion) for best results.

## 🤖 Agent Integration (System Prompt)

Memory is useless if your agent doesn't check it. To get the "Long-Term Memory" effect, you must instruct your agent to follow a strict protocol.

We provide a battle-tested **[Memory Protocol (AGENTS.md)](./AGENTS.md)** that you can adapt.

### 🛡️ Core Workflows (Context Protection)

The protocol implements specific flows to handle **Context Window Compaction** and **Session Restarts**:

1.  **🚀 Session Startup**: The agent *must* search for `TASK: in_progress` immediately. This restores the full context of what was happening before the last session ended or the context was compacted.
2.  **⏳ Auto-Continue**: A safety mechanism where the agent presents the found task to the user and waits (or auto-continues), ensuring it doesn't hallucinate a new task.
3.  **🔄 Triple Sync**: Updates **Memory**, **Todo List**, and **Files** simultaneously. If one fails (e.g., context lost), the others serve as backups.
4.  **🧱 Prefix System**: All memories use prefixes (`TASK:`, `DECISION:`, `RESEARCH:`) so semantic search can precisely target the right type of information, reducing noise.

These workflows turn the agent from a "stateless chatbot" into a "stateful worker" that survives restarts and context clearing.

### Recommended System Prompt Snippet

Instead of scattering instructions across IDE-specific files (like `.cursorrules`), establish `AGENTS.md` as the **Single Source of Truth**.

Instruct your agent (in its base system prompt) to:
1.  **Read `AGENTS.md`** at the start of every session.
2.  **Follow the protocols** defined therein.

Here is a minimal reference prompt to bootstrap this behavior:

```markdown
# 🧠 Memory & Protocol
You have access to a persistent memory server and a protocol definition file.

1.  **Protocol Adherence**:
    - READ `AGENTS.md` immediately upon starting.
    - Strictly follow the "Session Startup" and "Sync" protocols defined there.

2.  **Context Restoration**:
    - Run `search_text("TASK: in_progress")` to restore context.
    - Do NOT ask the user "what should I do?" if a task is already in progress.
```

### Why this matters?
Without this protocol, the agent loses context after compaction or session restarts. With this protocol, it maintains the **full context of the current task**, ensuring no steps or details are lost, even when the chat history is cleared.

## 🔌 Client Configuration

### Universal Docker Configuration (Any IDE/CLI)

To use this MCP server with any client (**Claude Code**, **OpenCode**, **Cline**, etc.), use the following Docker command structure.

**Key Requirements:**
1.  **Memory Volume**: `-v mcp-data:/data` (Persists your graph, embeddings, **and cached model weights**)
2.  **Project Volume**: `-v $(pwd):/project:ro` (Allows the server to read and index your code)
3.  **Init Process**: `--init` (Ensures the server shuts down cleanly)

> [!TIP]
> **Model Caching**: The embedding model (~1 GB) is stored in `/data/models/`. Using a **named volume** (`mcp-data:/data`) ensures the model is downloaded only once. Without a named volume, Docker creates a new anonymous volume on each `docker run`, causing the model to re-download every time.

#### JSON Configuration (Claude Desktop, etc.)

Add this to your configuration file (e.g., `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--init",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "--memory=3g",
        "-v", "mcp-data:/data",
        "-v", "/absolute/path/to/your/project:/project:ro",
        "ghcr.io/pomazanbohdan/memory-mcp-1file:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Replace `/absolute/path/to/your/project` with the actual path you want to index. In some environments (like Cursor or VSCode extensions), you might be able to use variables like `${workspaceFolder}`, but absolute paths are most reliable for Docker.

### Cursor (Specific Instructions)

1.  Go to **Cursor Settings** > **Features** > **MCP Servers**.
2.  Click **+ Add New MCP Server**.
3.  **Type**: `stdio`
4.  **Name**: `memory`
5.  **Command**:
    ```bash
    docker run --init -i --rm --memory=3g -v mcp-data:/data -v "/Users/yourname/projects/current:/project:ro" ghcr.io/pomazanbohdan/memory-mcp-1file:latest
    ```
    *(Remember to update the project path when switching workspaces if you need code indexing)*

### OpenCode / CLI

```bash
docker run --init -i --rm --memory=3g \
  -v mcp-data:/data \
  -v $(pwd):/project:ro \
  ghcr.io/pomazanbohdan/memory-mcp-1file:latest
```

### NPX / Bunx (No Docker required)

You can run the server directly via `npx` or `bunx`. The npm package automatically downloads the correct pre-compiled binary for your platform.

#### Claude Desktop

Add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "memory-mcp-1file"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Code (CLI)

```bash
claude mcp add memory -- npx -y memory-mcp-1file
```

#### Cursor

1.  Go to **Cursor Settings** > **Features** > **MCP Servers**.
2.  Click **+ Add New MCP Server**.
3.  **Type**: `command`
4.  **Name**: `memory`
5.  **Command**: `npx -y memory-mcp-1file`

Or add to `.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "memory-mcp-1file"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Windsurf / VS Code

Add to your MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "memory-mcp-1file"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Bun

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["memory-mcp-1file"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Unlike Docker, `npx`/`bunx` runs the binary **locally** — it already has access to your filesystem, so no directory mounting is needed. To customize the data storage path, pass `--data-dir` via args:
> ```json
> "args": ["-y", "memory-mcp-1file", "--", "--data-dir", "/path/to/data"]
> ```

### Gemini CLI

Add to your `~/.gemini/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "memory-mcp-1file"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or with Docker:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run", "--init", "-i", "--rm", "--memory=3g",
        "-v", "mcp-data:/data",
        "-v", "${workspaceFolder}:/project:ro",
        "ghcr.io/pomazanbohdan/memory-mcp-1file:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

> You must delete the data directory (volume) and re-index your data.
>
> Switching between models with the same dimensions (e.g., `e5_multi` <-> `nomic`) is theoretically possible but not recommended as semantic spaces differ.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap (Research & Ideas)

Based on analysis of advanced memory systems like [Hindsight](https://hindsight.vectorize.io/) (see their documentation for details on these mechanisms), we are exploring these "Cognitive Architecture" features for future releases:

### 1. Meta-Cognitive Reflection (Consolidation)
*   **Problem:** Raw memories accumulate noise over time (e.g., 10 separate memories about fixing the same bug).
*   **Solution:** Implement a `reflect` background process (or tool) that periodicallly scans recent memories to:
    *   **De-duplicate** redundant entries.
    *   **Resolve conflicts** (if two memories contradict, keep the newer one or flag for review).
    *   **Synthesize** low-level facts into high-level "Insights" (e.g., "User prefers Rust over Python" derived from 5 code choices).

### 2. Temporal Decay & "Presence"
*   **Problem:** Old memories can sometimes drown out current context in semantic search.
*   **Solution:** Integrate **Time Decay** into the Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) algorithm.
    *   Give a calculated boost to recent memories for queries implying "current state".
    *   Allow the agent to prioritize "working memory" over "historical archives" dynamically.

### 3. Namespaced Memory Banks
*   **Problem:** Running one docker container per project is resource-heavy.
*   **Solution:** Add support for `namespace` or `project_id` scoping.
    *   Allows a single server instance to host isolated "Memory Banks" for different projects or agent personas.
    *   Enables "Switching Context" without restarting the container.

### 4. Epistemic Confidence Scoring
*   **Problem:** The agent treats a guess the same as a verified fact.
*   **Solution:** Add a `confidence` score (0.0 - 1.0) to memory schemas.
    *   Allows storing hypotheses ("I think the bug is in auth.rs", confidence: 0.3).
    *   Retrieval tools can filter out low-confidence memories when answering factual questions.
